# Star Trek API Server

Star Trek is an American science fiction media franchise created by Gene Roddenberry, which began with the eponymous 1960s television series and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has expanded into various films, television series, video games, novels, and comic books. With an estimated $10.6 billion in revenue, it is one of the most recognizable and highest-grossing media franchises of all time. [Wikipidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek)

This project is the backend api. Please take a look at the frontend here [Star Trek Guid to Aliens](http://star-trek-beta.vercel.app/) to experience the project to its fullest.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express.js

I have been wanting to build a standalone api that anyone around the world can access. There is no fancy UI just our Star Trek API that anyone's frontend can consume.

## Lessons Learned

When working with this API I had to learn the hard way on being able to consume the API. Everything was fine and dandy when the api was deployed to Heroku. The big problem occurred when I would continue getting CORS errors when making requests to the API endpoints. After doing some searches online I added the CORS dependency to be able to get the errors to no longer occur.
